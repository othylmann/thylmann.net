# Research: Digital Humanization & Personal Storytelling

**Question**: How can a minimalist site showcase "the real human" (quirks, faults, stories, setbacks)?

## Summary (TL;DR)
The most effective way to humanize a technical site is to balance "Visible Success" with "Invisible Struggle." This is achieved through three pillars: **Structural Transparency** (Failure CVs), **Narrative Vulnerability** (The "Real About" page), and **Delightful Quirks** (Easter eggs).

## The Humanization Framework

### 1. Structural Transparency (The "Faults")
- **The Failure CV**: Popularized by [Johannes Haushofer](https://www.princeton.edu/~jhaushofer/publications/Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf). A dedicated list of rejections, failed ventures, and programs you didn't get into.
- **Codex Vitae (Value System)**: Inspired by [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/codex/). A living document of your current beliefs, acknowledging that they are "for now" and subject to change.

### 2. Narrative Vulnerability (The "Stories")
- **The "Story" vs. "About" Page**: Instead of a bio, use a narrative arc (Challenge -> Action -> Transformation).
- **Anecdote Boxes**: Small, pull-quote style blocks throughout the site that share 2-3 sentence personal stories.

### 3. Delightful Quirks (The "Personality")
- **The "Un-Business" Section**: A footer or sidebar dedicated to non-work things (e.g., "Currently obsessed with: [Specific Coffee Beans]").
- **Interactive Easter Eggs**: Konami codes, console messages, or a "Fun Mode."

## Recommendation
Start with a **"B-Side" About Section** or a **Failure Timeline** addition to provide high human impact with minimal design changes.
