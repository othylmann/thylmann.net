# PRD: The Contact Challenge

**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: Low (Delight Feature)

## Problem
A standard `mailto` link implies "I am available for cold outreach," which contradicts the persona of a high-profile serial entrepreneur.

## Solution
Turn the contact box into a "gate" that enforces using the social graph.

## User Story
**As a** visitor
**I want** to click "Contact Me"
**So that** I can send a message

**Unexpected Outcome (The Delight/Deflection)**:
instead of opening a mail client, the UI rejects the premise of easy contact.

**Behavior**:
- **Initial State**: Looks like a standard "Contact Me" button.
- **Micro-interaction**: On interaction, it morphs or shakes.
- **Message**: "Connection Refused. Protocol: Use The Network." or "Error 418: I'm a teapot. Find me on LinkedIn."

## Copy Ideas
1. "If you don't know my email, you should probably use LinkedIn."
2. "Access Denied. Use the social graph."
3. "404: Email not found. Try the connections above."
